# Major Project reflection.

-The hardest and most challenging aspect of the project was incoperaring matter.js in to p5js.
I spend a significant portion of time learning how matter.js works and the functions in it.
I had trouble making the bodies and intereacting with them.

-I solved all of the problems with the help of online tutorials such as () and with mr shellenbers help.
Once I was done fixing the problems making the game became considerabily more easier because Matter.js has but in functions for most of my requrements.

-if i was going to do the project again i will start  with matter.js renderer it might take me more time to learn the fuctions but i wouldn't have to use as many booleans or delay variable. Using the buit in renderer will also enablel me to display the game at higher frame rates and have smooth animations.

-I compleated all my need to have list and most of my nice to have list, the only nice to have that I didin't do is create a log in and server, convert to a mobile or desktop app, fancy animations and mods for better aiming.
